## Code Refactoring

This project is done on following Chapter 1 of Refactoring:

## Useful IDE functions for refactoring

Using the IDE IntelliJ, there are several short cuts and functions, you can use for refactoring. The one I used the most in this project is:

`Ctr` + `ALT` + `SHIFT` + `T` => Refactor or extract variables, methods (Invoke refactoring / Refactoring menu)

`Ctr` + `ALT` + `M` => Extract Method

`Ctr` + `ALT` + `C` => Extract Constant

`Ctr` + `ALT` + `P` => Extract Parameter

`Shift` + F6 => Rename
