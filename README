## Useful IDE functions for refactoring

Using the IDE IntelliJ, there are several short cuts and functions, you can use for refactoring. The one I used the most in this project is:

`Ctr` + `ALT` + `SHIFT` + `T` => Refactor or extract variables, methods (Invoke refactoring / Refactoring menu)
`Ctr` + `ALT` + `M` => Extract Method
`Ctr` + `ALT` + `C` => Extract Constant
`Ctr` + `ALT` + `P` => Extract Parameter
`Shift` + F6 => Rename
